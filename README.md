# Computer Vision and Explainable AI in Philippine Cinema

![Title](images/title.jpg)

Welcome to `dl-emotions` repository!

## Introduction

This project titled "Eme or Emotional: Leveraging Facial Recognition and XAI for Compelling Performances in Pinoy Cinema" delves into the world of computer vision and explainability methods, focusing on pre-trained models provided by Hugging Face. It also incorporates a novel explainability algorithm adapted from a publication documented on [GitHub](https://github.com/stevenstalder/NN-Explainer). The primary aim is to investigate how artificial intelligence and explainability techniques can revolutionize the Philippine cinema industry.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to address the challenges faced by aspiring actors in the Philippines. Access to quality coaching and consistent feedback can be limited, making it difficult for actors to hone their skills. To overcome these obstacles, we leverage facial recognition and explainable AI to provide objective and measurable insights to actors, democratize access to coaching resources, and facilitate practical learning from film performances.

## Key Highlights

- Analysis of emotional complexity in scenes.
- Effectiveness of pretrained models in addressing data scarcity.
- Consistent self-study approach for novice actors.

## Future Directions

This project serves as a foundation for future research and development in Philippine cinema. Some potential avenues for further exploration include:

- Expanding the analysis beyond facial expressions.
- Real-time application of AI in acting.
- Exploring cultural nuances in emotional expression.
- Analyzing emotional progression throughout scenes and movies.
